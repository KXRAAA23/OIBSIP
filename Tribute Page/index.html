            <p>Robert J. Oppenheimer (1904–1967) was a pioneering physicist and a key figure in the Manhattan Project, which developed the first nuclear weapons during World War II. His work continues to shape the conversation around science and ethics.</p>

            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>Oppenheimer was born in New York City in 1904 to a wealthy Jewish family. His exceptional intellect became apparent at an early age, and he attended Harvard University at 18, where he excelled in chemistry and physics. He went on to study at the University of Cambridge and later earned his PhD from the University of Göttingen in Germany, working under the guidance of renowned physicists like Max Born. During his time in Europe, Oppenheimer made significant contributions to quantum mechanics.</p>
            
            <h2>The Manhattan Project</h2>

            <p>During World War II, Oppenheimer was appointed scientific director of the Manhattan Project, leading a team of top scientists to create the atomic bomb. Under his leadership, the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico became the center for the development of the bomb. The project culminated in the successful Trinity test on July 16, 1945, which proved the bomb’s destructive potential. Just a few weeks later, the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, causing unprecedented devastation.</p>
            
            <h2>After the War and Ethical Dilemmas</h2>
            <p>Following the war, Oppenheimer became a vocal advocate for the peaceful use of nuclear energy and argued against the development of the hydrogen bomb, a weapon far more powerful than the atomic bomb. His stance brought him into conflict with policymakers, particularly during the Cold War. In 1954, Oppenheimer’s security clearance was revoked during the Red Scare, largely due to his past associations with Communist sympathizers. This decision ended his role as a public figure in science, but his legacy continued to spark debates on the moral implications of nuclear weapons.</p>
            
            <h2>Legacy and Reflection</h2>
            <p>Oppenheimer's legacy remains complex. While he is remembered as a brilliant scientist who led one of the most important technological achievements of the 20th century, he also struggled with the consequences of his creations. His famous quote after the Trinity test, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,” reflects the heavy burden he carried. Oppenheimer spent the remainder of his life reflecting on the ethical implications of atomic warfare and the role of science in society. He passed away in 1967, but his influence endures, especially in discussions about the intersection of science, ethics, and global security.</p>
